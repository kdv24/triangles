Description: This web app will evaluate the user-inputted side-lengths of a triangle to determine if it is a triangle, then return whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

# SetUp and Use
1. Simply open triangle.html in a browser window and enter the lengths of the sides of the triangle you would like to have evaluated.
2. If you want to try the program with the array and loop code instead, simply comment out scripts.js at line 7 - line 40 and un-comment lines 45 - line 64.  Either code will work.
